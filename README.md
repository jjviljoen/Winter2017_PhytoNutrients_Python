# Winter2017_PhytoNutrients_Python
This GitHub repository is related to the Preprint by Viljoen et al.: "Winter dynamics of phytoplankton and micronutrients in the Southern Ocean" available on ESS Open Archive at: https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.173884384.49518335/v1.

Included are Python scripts for processing and analyzing data collected during the Winter 2017 Cruise aboard the SA Agulhas II. The scripts are used to do statistical analyses and generate figures.

The compilation of original data used for the upper 150m (i.e. matched phytoplankton data) and compilation of trace metal data used for the upper 250m can be found in a Zenodo repository at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6615070 (Viljoen et al., 2025).

Each script contains a short description at the start.
